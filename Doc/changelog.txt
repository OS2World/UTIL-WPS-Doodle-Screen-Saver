* v2.3 : 2019.06.19
  - Target i686 instead of i586
  - Use the FPU rather then emulation
  - 32 bit code instead of 16 bit
  - Make the initial Desktop Properties taller.
  - Update Readme

* v2.2 : 2017.03.03
  - Don't install eCSBall by default
  - Update Rc files to use WarpSans
  - Update txt messages in WPSSDesktop to use WarpSans

* v2.1 : 2017.01.03.
  - Updated PrettyClock's zlib and libpng to latest versions.
  - Added AOS_Logo module.
  - Updated CairoClock and CairoShapes to use the system Cairo DLL installed
    by YUM/RPM.
  - Rebuilt with latest version of OpenWatcom.

* v2.0 : 2008.08.18.
  - The screen saver settings page now reports 180 Dialog Units as its minimal
    height, so most of it should be visible even on newly installed systems.
  - The screen saver modules are now running in a separate process when they
    are started for real saving (but not when they are running for preview
    mode). This should help to solve those kinds of memory and resource leaks 
    on which we have no control (e.g. leaks in DIVE subsystem).

* v1.9 : 2008.04.22.
  - Added new setting to first page of screen saver settings, to make it
    possible to disable VIO popups while the screen saving is active.

* v1.8 : 2008.02.11.
  - Added new API : SSCore_GetInactivityTime()

* v1.7.5 : 2007.03.08.
  - Modified DPMS handling, so that it can be told *NOT* to use SNAP, 
    but use direct VGA register access. This might be a bit risky, and 
    only supports ON and OFF modes, but this is the only working method
    when SNAP has problems with the monitor. A REXX tool has been 
    included to turn on/off this feature.
  - Added new module: SlideShow (Thanks to Warp5!)
  - Updated ShowImage and SlideShow modules to v1.7.1.
    They now use the GBM library to decode images, not the MMPM IOProcs.
  - Modified Cairo modules so they now link to Cairo v1.2.4
    This should resolve FontConfig problems.
  - Compiler upgraded to OpenWatcom v1.6.

* v1.7 : 2006.06.15.
  - Mouse movement detection changed, small mouse movement will not stop 
    screen saving now
  - Upgraded OpenWatcom compiler to v1.5
  - Added new scripts to source code package for easier building:
       MakeCopy.cmd (thanks to MrFawlty)
       makeall.cmd
       cleanall.cmd
       copy_files.cmd
  - Added Italian language support
  - The Matrix module has been optimized for speed (thanks to Rudi)

* v1.6 : 2006.03.14.
  - Made the change with password protection (introduced in previous version) 
    optional, selectable from first configuration screen. Most of the current 
    modules will honor the setting.
  - Some buttons on third page are disabled now for the time the modules are 
    being loaded/unloaded/configured.
  - Changed module defaults from full desktop resolution to 640x480.
    This may be a help for WarpOverlay modules, where the overlay does
    not support such high resolution.
  - Modified PrettyClock unskinned mode to remove the big red circle.
    (which was seen only on some computers anyway)
  - Added "Silver Clock" skin to PrettyClock.
  - Made Cairo Clock module NLS-enabled.
  - The appearance of the Cairo Clock module is changeable now.
  - Changed Cairo modules, they now need Cairo103.dll.
  - Fixed Randomizer module (was crashing with Cairo modules).
  - Fixed CairoShapes module crash.
  - Added new modules: Matrix, Snow, Moving Text
  - Upgraded OpenWatcom compiler to v1.4
  - The Swedish translation is not yet complete, sorry for that.

* v1.51 : 2006.01.12.
  - Some small visual changes:
    - Disable static text controls too when a feature is disabled
    - Added DT_MNEMONIC flag to most of the static text controls
  - Added russian language support
  - Fixed wrong Randomizer module configuration language when preview is disabled
  - Hopefully fixed AnTVSim module freezes
  - Querying the module list in settings windows can be time-consuming, so 
    the WAIT mouse pointer is shown for that time to inform the user about
    the background process. Done both in Screen Saver Settings and in Randomizer module.
  - Changed behaviour of password protection in modules, so even the keypress 
    triggering the password protection window will be treated as a password character.
  - Added two new modules: Cairo Clock and Cairo Shapes.
    Please note that these modules require Cairo v1.0.2 Runtime to be
    installed first. It can be installed from
    ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/Cairo/cairo-1.0.2-os2-bin.exe
  - Fixed module tester to work well with Cairo modules.

* v1.5 : 2005.06.11.
  - Wakeup-by-keyboard-only support
  - Added support for HOME directory. Now all settings are stored in
    .dssaver subdirectory in the HOME directory, if possible.
    This is done both in the core and in the available saver modules.
  - Made all the available modules NLS-enabled.
  - New saver module: Pretty Clock
  - New language support: French
  - New API functions: SSCore_GetCurrentState(), SSCore_WaitForStateChange()
  - SSCore_Initialize() now accepts path without trailing backslash
  - Various small fixes in general

* v1.4 : 2005.03.11.
  - Modified the way of loading NLS messages. This should solve problems with
    the settings pages switching back to English sometimes.
  - Added support for DBCS languages
    (both in settings pages and in currently available modules)
  - Added support for new languages: Swedish, Traditional Chinese
  - Added new module: Analogue TV Simulator
  - Fixed randomizer module config window
  - Settings pages now accept locale objects with private names, too, no need
    to name the locale objects to fit their locales.
  - Added WarpOverlay! support to modules utiliting DIVE
  - Added Security/2 password support

* v1.3 : 2005.02.13.
  - Changed method of checking if PM is in foreground.
    This should solve problems like starting the screen saver while the user
    is in a fullscreen DOS session, or not starting the saver while a VDM window is open.
  - SSDPMS now checks if SNAP is installed before calling SNAP functions.
    This should solve crashes on systems without Scitech SNAP.
  - Made the screen saver NLS enabled.
    Unfortunately, this requires that the old version has to be uninstalled before 
    installing this version. By default, the screen saver uses the current locale 
    (got from LANG environmental variable), but the language can be changed dynamically 
    by dropping a locale object onto the screen saving settings pages from the
    country palette (System Settings->Locale).
  - Added NLS support for saver modules.
  - Made the third settings page more simple, and more WPS-like.
  - The screen saver setting "Start at system startup" takes action only if
    the password protection is turned on.
  - The delayed password protection setting is not taken into account when
    the saver starts at system startup or when it starts by the request of
    the user (Lockup Desktop).
  - The saver is now sensitive to the WM_?SCROLL messages, too, and treats it as 
    user activity. (to support mice with wheel)
  - Modified Padlock module to remove flickering
  - Added new modules: Circles, Randomizer, and Show Image
  - Added Help

* v1.2 : 2005.01.10.
  - Added DPMS support for systems running Scitech SNAP
  - Added feature of Delayed password protection
  - Added feature of Start saver module on startup
  - Double-clicking on a saver module now means "Use this module"
  - Fixed DLL termination routine, causing infinite loop with misbehaving applications
  - SSCore_TempDisable() API now stops the screensaver if it's running
  - Modified all three saver modules (Blank, eCSBall, IFSIM) to stay on top of
    xCenter window, and made their password windows bigger to avoid text cutting
  - Added new module, the Bouncing padlock
  - Modified SSCore, so it won't start saver module if the PM is not in foreground
  - Mouse button release doesn't turn off saver now

* v1.0 : 2004.12.23.
  - First release
