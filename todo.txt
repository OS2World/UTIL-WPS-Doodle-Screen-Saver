Ideas for Screen Saver:
-----------------------

- Change setvars.cmd in cairo modules

- More animations and objects for Snow module
- Make CairoShapes NLS enabled (?)

- Make WPSSDesktop class a bit more general:
  It has no exported function to query DPMS capabilities and to query
  if Security/2 is present, but interfaces to SSCore directly. This
  dependency should be resolved, so others can completely override
  WPSSDesktop functions later.
  
- New function: Hot corners: Start now, and Never start corners.

- Don't let others steal the System Modal focus!
- REXX interface for the DSSaver API

- NLV readmes
- The saver modules might do a
  WinLockWindowUpdate(HWND_DESKTOP, ???)
  Dunno if it's really needed, but the original Lockup code does that.

Ideas for Saver modules to implement:
-------------------------------------

- Moving small ecs ball
- "Search-light" module
- "Rainy window" module
- Flash animation module (http://www.schleef.org/swfdec/ or GNASH once it will be ported)
